  <div class="header">SOURAV ROY CHOUDHURY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Sr. Dotnet and Full Stack Developer&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;12+ Years&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES</div>
  <div class="body">
    With more than 12 years of experience in enterprise software engineering, I have built my career around designing scalable architectures, modernizing legacy systems, and delivering solutions that directly support business growth. My foundation spans full‑stack .NET development, MVC architecture, Azure PaaS, and modern JavaScript frameworks, and I’ve consistently taken ownership of end‑to‑end delivery—from initial design to deployment and optimization. Over the years, I’ve engineered robust applications from scratch, implemented secure UI and API platforms across .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Angular, and contributed to systems that are core to organizational operations and customer experience.
    <br /><br />
    My technical strengths lie in cloud-native engineering, distributed workflows, and high‑volume integration systems. I have deep hands-on experience with Azure Functions, Durable Functions, Logic Apps, Service Bus, Key Vault, and Integration Accounts, enabling me to design stateful orchestrations and resilient pipelines that support mission‑critical workloads. One of my key achievements includes building a cloud solution capable of processing 8–10 million data flows per day, optimized to handle large files up to 500 MB while maintaining performance and reliability. I’ve also implemented secure NAESB‑based PGP encryption workflows, automated regression testing systems that process millions of records, and CI/CD pipelines that accelerate delivery while improving stability. My work consistently focuses on reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency—qualities that directly impact business continuity and customer trust.
    <br /><br />
    Looking ahead, my goal is to move deeper into cloud architecture and technical leadership, contributing to modernization initiatives and large‑scale platform transformations. I want to leverage my experience in Azure PaaS, serverless orchestration, and enterprise integration to design systems that are future‑ready, cost‑efficient, and aligned with long‑term business strategy. I see myself driving architectural decisions, mentoring engineering teams, and shaping solutions that help organizations scale confidently in a cloud‑first world. My vision is to continue growing as a leader who blends technical depth with strategic thinking, ensuring that technology not only solves today’s problems but positions the business for tomorrow’s opportunities.

  <div class="header-2">Senior Software Engineer — Tata Consultancy Services</div>
  <div class="header-3">Baltimore, Maryland | July 2023 – Present</div>
  <div class="body">
    In this role, I have been responsible for engineering full‑stack applications from the ground up using the MVC design pattern, C#, Entity Framework, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL, while also leveraging Angular for modern UI development. I designed and delivered secure UI and API applications across .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Angular, implementing API key–based authentication to ensure safe communication between systems. I contributed significantly to multi‑layer architecture design, applying SOLID principles to improve maintainability and scalability. My work also included building database structures—tables, stored procedures, functions, views—and optimizing them with indices, constraints, and triggers to support high‑performance data operations. This role strengthened my ability to deliver enterprise‑grade solutions that are cleanly architected, scalable, and aligned with business needs.
